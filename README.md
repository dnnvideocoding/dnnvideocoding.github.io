## Improving DASH Encoding with Scenes andDownscaling Techniques for VoD Streaming

### Abstract

>Video  content  represents  a  high  percentage  of  thetraffic   on   Internet   with   an   increasing   number   of   platformsoffering  live  and  on  demand  video.  Most  platforms  use  HTTPAdaptive Streaming (HAS) to deliver their content. In HAS, theprovider splits the videos in segments and each segment is offeredin multiple representations. The player can dynamically requestthe  appropriate  representation  for  the  next  segments  dependingon the varying conditions. This alleviates problems such as initialdelay  or  stalling,  thus  providing  a  better  quality  of  experienceto  users.  These  segments  can  have  a  fixed  duration  or  can  beadapted to match scenes up to a maximum duration of typically10 seconds. In this work, we study the effects in time, quality andsize of the encoded videos when downscaling the video to obtainthe  scenes.  The  experiments  are  performed  using  two  codecs:H.264  and  VP9,  and  using  10  videos  with  4K  resolution  witha  duration  of  more  than  150  seconds.  The  videos  are  encodedusing  fixed  segments  and  variable  segments  based  on  scenes(obtained from the downscaled video). Results show that the useof  downscaling  to  obtain  the  scenes  has  a  small  impact  on  thefinal  quality,  while  reduces  the  total  time,  the  consumption  ofcomputational  resources,  and  the  size  of  the  encoded  video.
